Python scripts for the HexChat IRC client.

#### [link-title-plus.py] (./link-title-plus/link-title-plus.py)
######(fork of [PDog](https://github.com/Poorchop)'s link-title.py script)

Each time anyone posts a link in chat, this script will show the title for that link.

It's possible to set it so that the title will be publicly announced on a custom list of channels. To do so, take a look at the code.

It also has better title formatting compared to the original version. Works with Python 3.

#### [youtube-video-title.py] (./youtube-video-title/youtube-video-title.py)
Same as above but channel public announcements are for YouTube links only. Works with Python 3.

YouTube API key is NOT needed!
